#### Note

1. all posts (.html or .md) should be stored under _posts/{category}/ with naming convention yyyy-mm-dd-{title}.md 
2. we can create more than one post on same day but be sure **title** within the file metadata and title of the file name are different from each other
3. **title** should have ðŸ“” emoji as post and ðŸŽ™ emoji as podcast at the beginning
4. For the podcast post, because the markdown cannot parse html script tag properly, we will just use html file for now
5. Add a new section of columns
